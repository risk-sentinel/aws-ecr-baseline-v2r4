 pulled from allows the organization to define what software can be run within the

 Demonstrate how the program execution is restricted. Look for a deny-all,
 permit-by-exception policy of restriction. Some methods for restricting
 execution include but are not limited to the use of custom capabilities built
 into the application or Software Restriction Policies, Application Security
 Manager, or Role-Based Access Controls (RBAC). If container platform
 whitelisting is not utilized or does not follow a deny-all, permit-by-exception
