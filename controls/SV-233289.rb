 implement encryption services for information requiring
 confidentiality.'
 desc 'Unvalidated cryptography is viewed by NIST as
 providing no protection to the information or data. In effect, the data would be
 considered unprotected plaintext. If the agency specifies that the information or
 data be cryptographically protected, then FIPS 140-2/140-3 is applicable. In
 essence, if cryptography is required, it must be validated. Cryptographic modules
 that have been approved for sensitive use may be used in lieu of modules that have
 been validated against the FIPS 140-2/140-3 standard. The cryptographic module used
 must have one FIPS-validated encryption algorithm (i.e., validated Advanced
 Encryption Standard [AES]). This validated algorithm must be used for encryption for
 cryptographic security function within the container platform component and
 information residing in the container platform registry and keystore. This
 requirement also applies to Zero Trust
 initiatives.'

 cryptographic modules are implemented to encrypt information
