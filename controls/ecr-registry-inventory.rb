 title 'ECR registry inventory (informational)'
 desc "
 Enumerates every ECR repository in the account/region so the HDF records the full
 assessed registry surface, and flags which repositories are excluded from scoring
 via excluded_repositories input. Most organizations run more than one registry;
 the per-repository registry controls iterate this in-scope set and score each repo
 independently (pass/fail per repo).

 Informational only: impact 0.0 renders this Not Applicable in the HDF rollup — it is
 scope/provenance metadata, never a pass or fail.

 # Resolved HERE, at control-body scope. An InSpec resource cannot be called
 # from inside a `describe` block — RSpec raises WrongScopeError, because a
 # describe body is an example GROUP, not an example. Resources are only
 # available at control scope (as above) or inside an `it`/`before`/`let`.
 # `check` and `json` do not evaluate control bodies, so this only surfaces on
 # a real exec (#11).

 # Reverse resolution (#11): supply-chain artifacts whose subject digest is

 # left behind, or the subject is a child manifest of a multi-arch Image
 # Index. Informational like the rest of this control — an orphan is
 # provenance metadata, not a compliance failure — but it must be VISIBLE,
 # because from the forward direction alone it is indistinguishable from
 # there being no signature at all.
