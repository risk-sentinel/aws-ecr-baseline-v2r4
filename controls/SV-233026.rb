 desc 'The container platform registry is used to store
 images and is the keeper of truth for trusted images within the platform. To
 guarantee the images integrity, access to the registry must be limited to those
 individuals who need to perform tasks to the images such as the update, creation, or
 deletion of images. Without this control access, images can be deleted that are in
 use by the container platform causing a denial of service (DoS), and images can be
 modified or introduced without going through the testing and validation process
 allowing for the intentional or unintentional introduction of containers with flaws
 and vulnerabilities. This requirement also applies to Zero Trust
 initiatives.'

 access. If least privilege and need-to-know access is not being used for
 container platform registry access, this is a finding.'

 privilege and need-to-know when granting access to the container platform registry.
 This fix ensures the proper roles and permissions are configured.'
