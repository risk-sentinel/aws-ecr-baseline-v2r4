 title 'Least privilege access and need-to-know must be required to access the container
 platform keystore.'
 desc 'The container platform keystore is used to store
 access keys and tokens for trusted access to and from the container platform. The
 keystore gives the container platform a method to store the confidential data in a
 secure way and to encrypt the data when at rest. If this data is not protected
 through access controls, it can be used to access trusted sources as the container
 platform breaking the trusted relationship. To circumvent unauthorized access to the
 keystore, the container platform must have access controls in place to only allow
 those individuals with keystore duties. This requirement also applies to Zero Trust
 initiatives.'

 with keystore duties have access to the container platform keystore. If users
 have access to the container platform keystore that do not have keystore duties,
 this is a finding.'

 privilege and need-to-know when granting access to the container keystore. This fix
 ensures the proper roles and permissions are configured.'
